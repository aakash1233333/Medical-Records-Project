# Medical_Records_Miniproject
Medical Records Project :-In India, the current mechanism used to store patient health records is outdated and exerts enormous pressure on both the patients and the healthcare providers. 
The main aim of the project was to create a nationwide Blockchain technology driven electronic healthcare system that has a potential to transform the Indian Healthcare Sector.
We wish to create a Digital Healthcare Ecosystem that allows Hospitals across the country to be digitally connected. 
The doctors across the country will have access to Personal Health Care records of the patient only after his approval.
